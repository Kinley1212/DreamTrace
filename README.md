## Project Overview

This project is a **2D point-and-click narrative game** developed between **April 2024 and August 2024** 

The game is inspired by *Chinese Dreamcore*, a nostalgic aesthetic and emotional trend emerging among young people in China.

With China’s rapid urban development, dramatic changes in cityscapes and lifestyles have created a strong sense of separation between past and present. As a result, nostalgia for the early 2000s—particularly around 2008 — has spread widely on the internet. This project responds to that cultural phenomenon by using interactive storytelling to revisit childhood memories while encouraging players to reflect on the present.

## Game Description

**DreamTrace** is a nostalgic, story-driven **first-person point-and-click game**. The purpose of the game is to allow players to return to the happiness of **2008**, make up for childhood regrets, and ultimately realize that dissatisfaction with the present may itself become a beautiful memory in the future.

The story begins in **2023**. The player feels frustrated with life and longs for the past. By accident, they travel back to **2008** through their childhood diary. Following the diary’s memories, the player revisits familiar locations such as **the park, school, and home**, reliving fragments of childhood happiness.

As the story unfolds, the player gradually discovers that **2023 is not the real world**. In fact, they have entered a **virtual reality system in 2050**, where a world war has broken out. The game concludes with a critical choice: **remain in the comforting virtual past, or return to reality and face the present.**

Through this narrative, the game warns players not to indulge excessively in nostalgia, while reminding them to cherish the present moment.
